In the next major 
version (pg-connectio
n-string v3.0.0 and 
pg v9.0.0), these 
modes will adopt 
standard libpq 
semantics, which 
have weaker security 
guarantees.

To prepare for this 
change:
- If you want the 
current behavior, 
explicitly use 
'sslmode=verify-full'
- If you want libpq 
compatibility now, 
use 'uselibpqcompat=t
rue&sslmode=require'

See https://www.postg
resql.org/docs/curren
t/libpq-ssl.html for 
libpq SSL mode 
definitions.
